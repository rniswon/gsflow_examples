Test problem 1b for Ag Package
Example problem 1b simulates irrigation water supplied by groundwater in a MODFLOW simulation modified from Test 1 in Prudic et al. (2004)
Simulation used the AG Package with the ETDEMAND option
The test is run with low and high ag field hydraulic conductivity
To run the model and generate figures from Ag Package paper run "run.bat"
