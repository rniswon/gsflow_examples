                      Sagehen Sample Problem for GSFLOW
                                 August 2015
 
Several GSFLOW Control and batch files are provided to run the sample 
problem in different model modes and for different module, solver, and 
input-data set options that are available for a GSFLOW simulation. These 
control and batch files are provided in the 'windows' subdirectory. Each 
of the .bat files shown in that directory without the prefix '_32' uses 
the 64-bit gsflow.exe version of the compiled software; batch files with 
the '_32' prefix use the 32-bit gsflow_32.exe version of the compiled 
software. 

The Control and batch files found in the subdirectory are for the following 
seven simulation conditions:

1. GSFLOW mode using the PCG solver and PRMS parameters split into five 
     separate Parameter Files. This condition also provides an example of the 
     use of the subbasin module, and a separate PRMS Parameter File 
     (subbasin.params) is provided to illustrate specification of the relevant 
     parameters: gsflow.bat and gsflow.control
2. GSFLOW mode using the NWT solver and PRMS Parameter Files for condition 1.
     Note that this sample problem also uses Control file gsflow.control, but
     resets the values of two of the parameters (modflow_name and subbasin_flag)
     in the batch file: gsflow_NWT.bat and gsflow.control
3. GSFLOW mode using the PCG solver and climate_hru module using pre-processed
     input climate data, to replace PRMS modules temp_1sta, precip_1sta, 
     ddsolrad, and potet_jh. Four of the Parameter Files used
     for conditions 1 and 2 are unchanged, and the fifth modified to include
     parameters required for use with the climate_hru model and to remove
     parameters not needed for climate_hru: gsflow_climate_hru.bat 
     and gsflow_climate_hru.control
4. PRMS-only mode using four Parameter Files, three of which are the same
     as those used in condition 1 and one of which was modified for a PRMS-only
     simulation. The Control File includes only those parameters needed for
     a PRMS-only simulation: gsflow_prms.bat and gsflow_prms.control
5. PRMS-only mode using pre-processed climate data using Parameter Files 
     very similar to condition 3, with the addition of a Parameter File that 
     contains parameters for groundwater cascades (ncascdgw.params): 
     gsflow_prms_climate_hru.bat and prms_climate_hru_control
6. PRMS-only mode demonstrating use of the Map Results module using five Parameter
     Files, four of which are the same as used in condition 4 and an additional
     file that specifies the mapping between the HRU and MODFLOW cell maps (file
     gvr.params): gsflow_prms_map_results.bat and gsflow_prms.control (with
     parameter mapOutOn_OFF reset to 1)
7. MODFLOW-only mode using the PCG solver and a minimum-input Control File:
     gsflow_modflow.bat and gsflow_modflow.control

The data-input files for the problem can be found in the 'input' subdirectory, 
which contains 'modflow' and 'prms' subdirectories. The 'modflow' subdirectory 
contains files related to the MODFLOW and MODFLOW-NWT components of GSFLOW. The 
'prms' subdirectory contains the Data and Parameter files for each simulation. 
The files ending in 'day' refer to pre-processed climate-data files used with the 
Climate by HRU Distribution module.

Double-click on one of the .bat files to run the model. The sample problems also 
can be run from a Windows command-prompt window (see the Readme.txt file in the 
main GSFLOW directory).

A gsflow.log file will be written directly to the 'windows' subdirectory. Output 
files generated by the Map Results module also will be written to the subdirectory. 
Additional output files will be written to the 'output' subdirectory and to the 
'modflow' and 'prms' subdirectories under the 'output' subdirectory. The names of 
the output files are specified in either the GSFLOW Control File or the MODFLOW 
name file for each simulation. Several types of files will be generated, each of 
which is described in detail in the GSFLOW documentation. These include:

1. GSFLOW water-budget file (example: gsflow.out)
2. GSFLOW comma-separated-values (CSV) File (example: gsflow.csv)
3. PRMS water-budget file (example: sagehen_prms.out)
4. MODFLOW or MODFLOW-NWT listing file (example: sagehen.mf.list)
5. Calculated heads file for MODFLOW or MODFLOW-NWT (example: 
     head_sagehen.out)
6. MODFLOW GAGE Package output files (example: sagehen_sfrseg13.out)
7. MODFLOW UZF Package output files (example:uz1_sagehen.out)

Several output files are provided with the distribution for comparison
to the results of your simulations. These files are provided in the 
'output-test' subdirectory and are arranged by the simulation mode and
seven model conditions described above. (The results provided were
generated using the 64-bit executable; results for the 32-bit executable
should be nearly identical to those provided.) The results will differ slightly
from previous versions because of changes to the code and because the bottom
elevation of layer 2, row 51, column 58 was changed from 1,185 meters to
1,980 meters, which is more consistent with surrounding cells.
